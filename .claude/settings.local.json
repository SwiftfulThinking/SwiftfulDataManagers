Tests cover all public APIs including:\n\n- Initialization with and without cached data\n- Document/collection fetching (sync and async)\n- Save, update, and delete operations\n- Query operations with QueryBuilder\n- Error handling for not found scenarios\n- logIn/logOut functionality for sync managers\n\nAll 58 tests pass successfully.
